## Instructions

- Create a new branch called `your-name-dd-mm`
- Complete the tasks listed below
- Open a pull request

## Tasks

1. Make alternating rows different colors.
2. Format the `Price` column to match the pattern `$X.XX`
3. Implement the `removeItem` function to the app. The function already exists as an action and is already imported in the `List` component. All that's left is to implement the reducer and call the function in the component while also adding a button.
